libcda is in part derived from BCD.  The original licence is below:

  "You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in
  any way you like, but if you do you must send me something in
  exchange.  This could be a complimentary copy of a game, an addition
  or improvement to BCD, a bug report, some money (this is
  particularly encouraged if you use BCD in a commercial product), or
  just a copy of your AUTOEXEC.BAT if you don't have anything
  better. If you redistribute BCD or make a game using it, it would be
  nice if you mentioned me somewhere in the credits."


Since Brennan seems to have fallen off the face of the net, and the
work is no longer called BCD, and is no longer a one-man job, a few
words have been altered, giving us:

  You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in
  any way you like, but if you do you should contribute something in
  exchange.  This could be a complimentary copy of a game, an addition
  or improvement to libcda, a bug report, some money (as long as you
  can track down and send it to all contributors), or just a copy of
  your AUTOEXEC.BAT or .bashrc if you don't have anything better.  If
  you redistribute libcda or make a game using it, it would be nice if
  you mentioned the contributors somewhere in the credits.
