		Libcda 0.2 (alpha)

		26 January 2000


   libcda is "A simple, cross-platform CD playing library".  It was
   designed to be used in computer games, but obviously this is not
   necessary.

   It also has the forgettable name that is mandatory for all CD audio
   playing libraries.

   It currently supports:
	 Linux + gcc (only i386 tested)
	 DOS + djgpp
	
   Windows and other platforms will be supported as soon as
   *someone* contributes some code.


FUNCTIONS

   Lifted straight from the source code; sorry!  Please see `example.c' 
   for proper usage and `libcda.h' for function prototypes.

   cd_init:
     Initialise library.  Return zero on success.
     You must do this.

   cd_exit:
     Shutdown.  You must call this at the end of the program.
   
   cd_play:
     Play specified track.  Return zero on success.
   
   cd_play_range:
     Play from START to END tracks.  Return zero on success.
   
   cd_play_from:
     Play from track to end of disc.
     Return zero on success.
   
   cd_current_track:
     Return track currently in playback, or zero if stopped.
   
   cd_pause:
     Pause playback.
   
   cd_resume:
     Resume playback.
   
   cd_is_paused:
     Return non-zero if playback is paused.
   
   cd_stop:
     Stop playback.
   
   cd_get_tracks:
     Get first and last tracks of CD.
     Return zero on success.
   
   cd_is_audio:
     Return 1 if track specified is audio,
     zero if it is data, -1 if an error occurs.
   
   cd_get_volume:
     Return volumes of left and right channels.
   
   cd_set_volume:
     Set left and right channel volumes (0 - 255).
   
   cd_eject:
     Eject CD drive (if possible).
   
   cd_close:
     Close CD drive (if possible).


   The API is deliberately designed to be simple, omitting functions
   for querying track times, etc.  If you can provide implementations
   of a function you would like for ALL supported platforms, then I
   will include it.
